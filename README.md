# Join me on this journey!

This is the home of my personal blog website where I document my journey through the tech industry. As a student and tech enthusiast, I'm sharing my experiences, insights, and discoveries as I navigate the professional world and continue my educational journey.

## Key Features:

- Technology Stack: This blog website is built with [Astro JS](https://astro.build/), offering fast and optimized web performance.
- Package Manager: I use [Bun](https://bun.sh/) as the package manager of choice, providing speed and efficiency in managing project dependencies, instead of the traditional npm.
- Deployment: The website is hosted and deployed using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), making it easily accessible to anyone interested in following my journey.

Join me on this exciting adventure in the tech industry and education. Explore my blog posts, tutorials, and insights as I grow and learn in this ever-evolving field. Your feedback and contributions are always welcome! 🚀

Feel free to connect and engage with me as I share my experiences in tech and education. Your support and collaboration are greatly appreciated. 📚💻✨

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── content/
│   ├── layouts/
│   └── pages/
├── astro.config.mjs
├── README.md
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro&#39;s Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
